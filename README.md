# Roast

Create archive tarballs and roast them!

## Reason of existence

I am trying to split the logic from [obs-service-cargo](https://github.com/openSUSE-Rust/obs-service-cargo).
Not only is this a library, it also contains binaries that extract and decompress tarballs or create
tarballs with the available highest level compression for supported compression formats.

Plus, it has the comfort of being a simple `tar` alternative.

# How to install the binaries

Roast contains to binaries
- `roast`
- `raw`
- 

## Cargo

**From source**:
```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/openSUSE-Rust/roast
```

**From crates.io**:
```bash
cargo install roast-cli
```

Both commands pull from source. The only difference is that the first one
obviously relies on git.

## CLI
